         <h1>Console App</h1>
         <h2>The Console is a tool developers use to check program's functionality. Calculations can be stored and printed
             on the console to check if the program working with numbers is correct. The user can also see the console, but
             they will probably not understand what is going on. To print (or in other words, write) on the console, the
             javascript syntax, console.log(); , is used. The value or string that you want to write goes inside the
             brackets.
